## Data

### Employment Data

The U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS includes the employment data of the whole America and also specific areas. I am going to use the industry ranking data and occupation salary ranking data of Pittsburgh area and San Francisco Area. Based on these data extracted from U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, I can compare the employment opportunities of Pittsburgh and San Francisco. 
https://www.bls.gov/sae/

The NUMBO includes the Current Cost of Living Index by City of America. By this dataset, I can compare the cost-of-living index of Pittsburgh and San Francisco. 
https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/region_rankings_current.jsp?region=019

From the American Public Transportation Association website, the national transit dataset can be downloaded, which include the data about the public transportation of different cities of America. With this data, I can compare the public transportation types and coverage of Pittsburgh and San Francisco.

The DEATH PENALTY INFORMATION CENTER shows the crime rates of cities in America from 1970 to 2017, which can be used to compare the crime rates of Pittsburgh and San Francisco to evaluate the safety of these cities.

For this project, I planned to use Shorthand as a digital medium that could help me represent the entire story. Therefore, all pictures and textual content will be delivered through Shorthand.

2. Flourish & Tableau

Flourish and Tableau are both good tools to build different kinds of charts. I will use Flourish and Tableau to develop bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, word clouds and maybe some other kinds of visualization.

3. FT's Visual Vocabulary

I will refer to FT's Visual Vocabulary to help me choose the most suitable chart type.

4. Other tools and references mentioned in class

I will also refer to tools and references mentioned in class, such as how to use color properly, how to use text properly, and so on.
