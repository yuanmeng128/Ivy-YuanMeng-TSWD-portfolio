# Final Project III: Final data story

## The final data story

## Review of my work

### How I used everything I created in Part I and Part II to develop my final project?

In the part one of my final project, I firstly introduced my topic briefly and why I chose this topic. This brief introduction of why I chose this topic became the hook of my final story. Then, I develop an outline which serves as a guide of all my later work. Next, I draw a draft of my story by hand which frames my entire story. Since I invest lots of efforts on the first sketch of my whole story, my second draft using shorthand and my final story went very well. Most importantly, since my first draft was very complete, I got many useful feedbacks by showing my first draft to interviewees. At last, I listed the datasets and visualization tools and medium I was going to use. My first version of visualizations in part two and my final version of visualizations in my final story used the data extracted from the datasets I listed in the part 1 and applied the visualization tools and medium I mentioned in part 1. In a word, part 1 depicts the prototype of my final story and lays a good foundation for my later work.

In the part two of my final project, I implement my hand-drawn draft in part 1 with shorthand, flourish, and tableau. Then, I showed the digital draft to several interviewees. **My targeted audience are graduates facing the choice of where to live after graduation and other people who want to move to a new city.** Since many studetns around me will graduate soon and face the choice problem. So, I interviewed them who are my targeted audience, to collect feedbacks. I got many useful in the perspectives of both content and design and realized these suggestions in my final story.
*For the content:
1. I am comparing Pittsburgh and San Francisco. If audience are facing choices among other cities, my story may be not useful. -> **To improve on this point, in my final story, I not only include the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco but also include the data of other cities. Besides, in the end of my story, I provide audience with many useful links, through which they can find the data of the city they are intersted in.** 
2. Some interviewees thought that sports culture of a city is importand but this is not included in my story. -> **Personally, I agreed with the interviewee, sports culture is also an important factor when choosing which city to live. But if I add a new section for sports, my story would be too long. Finally, I integrated the sports to my culture part.**
3. Too many texts, so audience may be impatient to read. -> **Firstly, I condensed my text. Then, I emphasized key poingts by changing the font color, increasing the font size and bolding font. So, audience can get the core of my content more easily.**
*For the design:
1. In the visualizations of the "job opportunity" part, there are too many categories and make the chart unreadable. -> **I assigned these industries to 11 sectors, which made the bar chart shorter and more readable. I also highlighted the industry I care most to deliver my message to audience more clearly.**
2. In the visualizations of the "cost of living" part, there are too many countries in the point chart so some points overlapped -> **Finally, I didn't remove all the data of other cities and just keep the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Instead, besides Pittsburgh and San Francisco, I keep the data of top 10 populated cities. By doing this, I made the chart more clear and can also provide some useful information for audience not choosing between Pittsburgh and San Francisco.**
3. In the visualization of the "crime rate" part, some data is unnecessary and the text in the chart was too long. -> **I removed useless data and moved the text in the chart to the explanation next to the chart.**

### Reflects on changes I made since the completion of part two.

First of all, after viewing other students' stories, I found that my design was too rough. So I further explored functison of the shorthand, and redesigned my typography, and the use of colors and images to make my whole story more delicate and beautiful.

Secondly, in my first and second drafts, my reference was not done well. Therefore, I reviewed quiz 1 content and added the references of texts and pictures in my final story according to the instructions of quiz 1.

Finally, I found others' feedbacks are very important. Because I am very familiar with my topic and have comprehensize background knowledge, the explaination and visaulizations which I think very clear may not be easy for audience to understand. Therefore, I interviewed many people to improve my text descriptions and charts. I asked audience where they may be confused with and then improve on these confusing parts. I also interviewed them do they think my story is helpful and what they think can be added to enhance my story content.

### Summary of my working process and final thoughts

When I first chose topic, I was considering what data would be easy to obtain firstly, so the topic I chose was too broad. What's more, these topics are not relevant to me, so it was difficult for me to develop the story. Then, I shifted my thinking a bit, started to think about topics that were relevant to me and I was very interested in, and then searched the data. Through this, I found a specific and interesting story.

After determining the topic, I made a very detailed outline and drew a complete draft, so that I could get more specific suggestions from others. After I interviewed my classmates and professors, they thought my topic was interesting, but it still needed some adjustments in the details, such as how to make my story more useful to others. I then drew the first digital version in shorthand based on my first draft and collected the feedback for my digital version. This time, I got more advice on the design and visualization. At the same time, I also got some design inspiration by viewing other people's stories.

I've made a lot of changes to my first shorthand version. First, I've added various designs to make my story more attractive, such as some dynamic designs of shorthand. Then I made some adjustments to the flow of my content to make the story more fluid. Finally, I made some adjustments in some details, such as the unity of colors. My whole story uses orange to represent Pittsburgh and blue to represent San Francisco. I also honed each visualization to make them as concise as possible without compromising integrity. In a word, I made a number of changes to the design and content of my first shorthand version, making my story prettier and clearer.

Through this project, I not only mastered many visualization tools, like shorthand, flourish and so on, and applied many visualization theories and tips learned in class, but also got some design ideas and understood the importance of audience's opinions. All in all, I think both my technical and soft skills have improved.
