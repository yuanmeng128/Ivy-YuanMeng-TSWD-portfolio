# Final Project II

## Wireframes and storyboards

[Shorthand preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/EPj1gtuqofzcd1SE)

## User research and interviews

a. the target audience I hope to reach with my story

Giving me a chart may help me quickly get this idea. You might want to show a pyramid-like structure where the bottom has those low-score o
