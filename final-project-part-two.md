# Final Project II

## Wireframes and storyboards

[Shorthand preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/EPj1gtuqofzcd1SE)

## User research and interviews

a. the target audience I hope to reach with my story

My story is about how do I make a decision between Pittsburgh and San Francisco to live in after my graduaction. I hope my story can reach people who are facing the similar choice problem, such as graduates like me, people planning to move to another city, and so on. 

b. my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Since there are many students around me who are going to graduate this year, I interview some of them who haven't decided which city to live in after graduation to find whether my story can help them.

c. my interview script

I ask my interviewees five questions:
Q1: Could you identify the audience for this wireframe?
Q2: Do you think this wireframe be helpful?
Q3: What are the things that you felt to be confused? 
Q4: What other aesthetic aspects do you think I can further improve?
Q5: What other information do you think will be helpful to cover in this story?

d. the findings from my interviews

Interviewee  | Feedback
------------- | -------------
In class interview | A1: New graduates.<br />A2: Helpful, many students in CMU face simialr choice between Pittsburgh and San Francisco. <br />A3: No. In general, the logic is clear and the information is useful. <br />A4: There are too many factors included in the job opportunity part. Just keep the cost of living index of Pittsburgh and San Francisco instead of all top cities. Change the color of the scores in the table to make them more clear. <br />A5: There may be some students in CMU who are going to work in the same industry and face the same choice problem with you. It will be more helpful if my story can include more information more specific for this group.
Student, 24' | A1: New graduates.<br />A2: Helpful, especially the "crime rate" part and "cost of living" part which include many useful information. <br />A3: No.<br />A4: The cost of crime is not useful for me which can be removed.  <br />A5: It will be more helpful if the entertainment like restaurants distribution can be added.
Student, 24' | A1: Graduate students going to find jobs or people going to move.<br />A2: Genrally helpful. But the story is too personal, people may not choose between Pittsburgh and San Francisco. <br />A3: Why mentioning other cities like LA, Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Orlando in the "“When choosing which city to live in, which factors should we consider?” part? <br />A4: Too many texts. Audience may be too lazy to read. <br />A5: No. The charts are great.
