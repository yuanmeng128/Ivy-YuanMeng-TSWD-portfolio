# Final Project II

## Wireframes and storyboards

[Shorthand preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/EPj1gtuqofzcd1SE)

## User research and interviews

a. the target audience I hope to reach with my story

My story is about how do I make a decision between Pittsburgh and San Francisco to live in after my graduaction. I hope my story can reach people who are facing the similar choice problem, such as graduates like me, people planning to move to another city, and so on. 

b. my approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Since there are many students around me who are going to graduate this year, I interview some of them who haven't decided which city to live in after graduation to find whether my story can help them.

c. my interview script

I ask my interviewees five questions:
Q1: Could you identify the audience for this wireframe?
Q2: Do you think this wireframe be helpful?
Q3: What are the things that you felt to be confused? 
Q4: What other aesthetic aspects do you think I can further improve?
Q5: What other information do you think will be helpful to cover in this story?

d. the findings from my interviews

Interviewee  | Feedback
------------- | -------------
In class interview | A1: New graduates.<br />A2: Helpful, many students in CMU face simialr choice between Pittsburgh and San Francisco. <br />A3: No. In general, the logic is clear and the information is useful. <br />A4: There are too many factors included in the job opportunity part. Just keep the cost of living index of Pittsburgh and San Francisco instead of all top cities. Change the color of the scores in the table to make them more clear. <br />A5: There may be some students in CMU who are going to work in the same industry and face the same choice problem with you. It will be more helpful if my story can include more information more specific for this group.
Student, 24' | A1: New graduates.<br />A2: Helpful, especially the "crime rate" part and "cost of living" part which include many useful information. <br />A3: No.<br />A4: The cost of crime is not useful for me which can be removed.  <br />A5: It will be more helpful if the entertainment like restaurants distribution can be added.
Student, 24' | A1: Graduate students going to find jobs or people going to move.<br />A2: Genrally helpful. But the story is too personal, people may not choose between Pittsburgh and San Francisco. <br />A3: Why mentioning other cities like LA, Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Orlando in the "“When choosing which city to live in, which factors should we consider?” part? <br />A4: Too many texts. Audience may be too lazy to read. <br />A5: No. The charts are great.
Student, 24' | A1: Students who are going to graduate or general people who want to compare two cities for living. The author clearly declared this information at the third and the last threads. <br />A2: The author selected four out of eight essential dimensions to showcase the differences between the two cities. I believe these dimensions are sufficient to assist audiences who need to choose between the two cities. However, more information is always better. If possible, the author could choose to present all the information related to these eight dimensions, to provide a comprehensive reference for people with different professions. <br />A3: In the fourth thread of the wireframe, the author used chunks of consecutive text to explain the meaning and value of the 8 dimensions, but this may not be as important for the audience because in most cases, they do not need to read such a large amount of text to understand the importance of things like job opportunities or cost of living. <br />A4: Color consistency is crucial for a wireframe because it allows viewers to locate the most important information with minimal effort. For example, all content related to Pittsburgh, whether it is text or bars on charts, can be marked with the same color, such as red. Similarly, all content related to San Francisco can be marked with blue. This is because, in general, red and blue are highly distinguishable colors with significant contrast. They are often used for comparison. <br />A5: Sports are an essential part of American culture. I personally will heavily weight and compare the sports culture scores of the two cities. Additionally, the scatter plot titled "Cost of Living Ranking in the U.S." does not visually display a clear comparison of the two key cities because a large number of gray dots obstruct their appearance. My suggestion is to only keep a small number of valuable reference cities, such as New York, Chicago, San Diego, San Antonio, and so on. This way, the audience could see a clearer comparison.o

Consistent feedback: 
- Too many texts
- In some charts, the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco are not obvious.
- Add entertainment information of the two cities

Conflicts:
- Some interviewees think I should just keep the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco, while some interviewees think I should also include data of other cities which can help audience choosing among other cities.

e. changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week to address the issues identified.

For the story content:
- Besides the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco, I will also include the data of other cities which may be helpful for audience who are making decisions among other cities. However, I will highlight the data of Pittsburgh and San Francisco to make sure that the whole story is still my own story and also more specific to people facing the same choice problem.     
- I will add an entertainment part to introduce the recreational facilities of the two cities, like restaurants, sports facilities, and so on, which is also important when choosing a city to live in.
- I will further summarize my text content to make the content more concise and reduce the text volume. 
- I will include useful website links which can help audience get useful information to compare cities at the end of the story. By doing this, I don't need to include the informaion of all factors useful when choosing which city to live in and make my story too long, and can still help users get information on factors not important for me and not mentioned in my story.

For the aesthetic aspects:
- For the "job opportunity" part, I will combine similar industries to shorten the bar chart, just keep one y-axis for the two bar charts to make the comparison more clealy and make the chart more concise, and I will highlight the industry I care most.
- For the "cost of living" part, I will use lighter color to highlight Pittsburgh and San Francisco. Though one of my interviewees suggested me to remove the data of other cities, I will still keep other cities to provide useful information to audience making decision among other cities.
- For the "crime rate" part", since the cost of crime indexes are not very useful, I will remove these two factors.
- For the score stable, I will change the color of "+1" and final scores in the tables to make it easier to read.
- The colors used through the story should be uniform. Use the same orange to represent Pittsburgh, and the same blue to represent San Francisco.
